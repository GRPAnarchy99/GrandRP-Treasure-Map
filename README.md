## GTA V - GrandRP - Treasure Map
https://grpanarchy99.github.io/GrandRP-Treasure-Map/

This interactive map is a derivative of work created by Jesse Gardner (see below) as the Grand Theft Auto V Interactive Map.  This map focuses on capturing map location for treasures that spawn in GrandRP servers every hour for immediate use by our in-game family, Anarchy99 (English Server #2).

The mapping library used is [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). The points are stored as GeoJSON files with one file corresponding to each layer. Each GeoJSON feature has a property called *imgname* that stores the location of the screenshot that corresponds to that point.

Gardner created this single page application specifically to be stored and used on Github to save on hosting costs. This does unfortunately mean that there is some performance issues at times with rendering the basemap.  Hosting for this interactive map may eventually change based on usage and perfomrance issues.

## To Do:
* Continue to add new treasure locations until list is exhausted
* Begin mapping spawn locations for other collectibles (metal, drugs, strawberries, etc.)
